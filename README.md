# LinkUp
This project was built during the RUHacks hackathon event.

This project allows users to upload events with different attributes and restrictions, allowing other users to view those events and register if they are interested. This was to help those that may not have alot of friends, or are new to an area and want to meet new people. This project has a unique feature that allows users to upload a spontaneous event, and then users within a certain KM radius recieving a notification about that event. 

This app allows new people to connect, make friends, build a sense of community in their neighbouhood and most importantly have fun.

## Getting Started
Register an account on the event. There are then options to explore the map and view events around you, as well as make your own event.

### Built with
The app was developed using android studio IDE and adobe XD for front end design. Java was the primary language, with a SQLite database being used for data storage. Google Map APIs were used for the map feature. Git was used for team collaboration. 

#### In the future
We would continue to improve the database information exchange. We would also have to optimimze certain parts of the app to handle all the requests. Finally, we would want to include some sort of security feature using image proccessing and some sort of goverment database to prevent the wrong people from using our app.
