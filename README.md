# Project Title
In this project we created an app that allow anyone to create/join a local team game or sport, such as: soccer, basketaball, football, etc.
It works by taking the GPS coordinate system of all users and connecting them based off of a max cut of radius. From there yuo will be able to join/create an event based off of sport, location and time.
This app allows new people to connect, make friends, build a sense of community in their neighbouhood and most importantly have fun.
